# BVAB-and-Lac-sequences
The database contains a collection of ribosomal sequences for BVAB (Bacterial vaginosis associated bacteria) and common vaginal Lactobacillus species.

BVAB is a group of fastidious bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis. Three groups of BVAB (BVAB-1, BVAB-2, BVAB-3) have been designated according to their sequence types. So far, most studies on BVAB are based on qPCR, and not many BVAB sequences has been publised. Here, we present a collection of BVAB ribosomal RNA sequences downloaded from the publised work. Please find the BVAB database in  <code>**BVAB_rRNA_database.fa**</code> 

Lactobacilli are the most abundant vaginal bacteria in women. While ribosomal sequences of Lactobacilli have limited resolution in species level. In our study "Vaginal microbiota and human papillomavirus infection among young Swedish women", 341F and 805R primer pair was applied to amplify the V3-V4 regions from the 16S rRNA genes from the vaginal swab samples collected from 157 Swedish women. DADA2 program was used to generate amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), SILVA database (v128) was applied to classify the ASVs till species level. In addition, manual BLAST search of the Lactobacilli ASVs againt NCBI databse was conducted to obtain more species annotations. The collection of the ASVs with designated Lactobacillus species was extracted to generate a Lactobacilli spp database <code>**HPVaC_Lactobacillus_spp.fa**</code>
